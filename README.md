ppmck
=====
A code to make your own NES Sound Files. This is my fork of ppmck9ex11-3

Compile
=======
On *nix (Mac OSX included)
```
cd src
sh make_binary.sh
```

the scripts include native + cross compile to windows. If you don't have the cross-compiler for windows,
the native build will still succeed ;) -- files output to parent "bin" directory
